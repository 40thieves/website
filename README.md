# CodeMirror 6 website

This repository holds the sources for the work-in-progress new website
for CodeMirror 6.

For now, it expects to be checked out inside the `codemirror.next`
repository (it needs access to the sources to build the reference
docs), and quite likely won't build on other people's machines (but do
open issues when you try).

```
npm run build
ls output # ‚Üê the website is in there
```
